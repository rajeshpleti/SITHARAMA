# 1. Key features Of Elysium Analytics <span id="KeyFeatures"><span>
	
	
	Elysium Analytics is a machine learning based log analysis solution for security minded mid-sized to large enterprises, challenged by the volume of security log data today both from an infrastructure as well as an analytics and detection perspective.   
	We have simplified onboarding of data, provide a scalable data lake analytics platform, and search on a pay-as-you-go basis . 
	Since we are built on top of Snowflake, our SaaS solution is truly a cloud scale security analytics platform that removes the barriers from ingesting, contextualizing, searching, analyzing, and storing log data with a cost effective and low risk service. 
	Unlike the other log analysis vendors in this market, our SaaS offering is licensed on a usage basis lowering cost and removing financial risk.  You pay a low price for storage, and compute is billed by the minute of usage.  
	Additionally, we have an open platform with no vendor lock-in, customizable analytics models, as well as APIs for end user development of analytics models. 


	Elysium Analytics provides a single pane of glass through an SOC analyst identifies, observes  aggregated views of all activity of users and entities across an enterprise.
	This is achieved through the use of profilers, perform data sketches across time intervals on security metrics to baseline, behaviours of users and entities, MITRE ATT&CK vectors. 

	To unify the underlying data schema, Elysium Analytics has created an advanced “layered” schema architecture that supports different log vendors  “views” into the same ODM schema. 
	Elysium is committed to providing open security framework deployments with add-ons that enable our customers to utilize analytics created by security framework.

	###1. Insider Threat Detection
	Insider Threat Detection Show users who are deviating from normal behavior and detect statistical anomalies and outliers with unsupervised learning clustering across numerous features
	###2. Privileged Account Usage
	Identify privileged users, services, and shared accounts and then monitor them for abnormal usage associated with insider and external attacks.
	###3. DNS Tunneling
	Detect DNS tunneling attacks used for malicious file transfers, payload downloads, or remote access.
	###4. VPN Monitoring
	Profile geo-location of users & endpoints and compute the number of simultaneous VPN connections during any minute of any day to detect unauthorized access.
	###5. Unusual File Access
	Identify excessive and abnormal file activity on endpoints and detect individuals, or malware controlled by attackers, attempting to search for and steal valuable digital assets.
	###6. Data Exfiltration
	Detect unauthorized transfer of data from a user's computer or servers carried out by someone manually or automatically by malware on the network.
	###7. Bot Attack 
	Detect bot traffic and attacks in real-time by monitoring high velocity connections and port scans across devices within the corporate network.
	###8. Unusual File Downloads
	Protect your network and  users from malicious content and binaries by detecting downloads from low prevalence and suspicious sites and domains.
	###9. Leverage data science platforms (Advanced AI/ML Techniques)
	Build your own ML models on Databricks or other preferred data science platforms to  detect new evolving threats.
	###10. Phishing Attack
	Profile email use patterns and detect unusual and potentially high risk email messages from low prevalence and suspicious domains.
	###11. New IP Addresses
	Protect your network and users from malware downloads, drive-by attacks, and phishing attacks through profiling of new IPs and detection of connections to low prevalence IPs.
	###12. Build your own Analytical dashboards
	Build your own analytics dashboards with Looker or connect to 3rd party applications through our API.

	###1.360 view <span id="360view"><span>
	
	Elysium offers to show all the information of a user or an entity for Last 30 Days.
	Shows login patterns (successful & failed logins) for the last 7 and 30 days for the user/entity in context
	Shows all machines access for the last 7 days and 30 days by users and entity’s
	Amount of data pushed to web versus his community
	Access to any suspicious or dark sites.
	Show escalated privileges by user/entity

	###2.	Alerts <span id="alerts"><span>
	
	Elysium alerts Monitors continuously query your data to monitor and send notifications when specific events occur.
	thresholds, critical, warning, and missing data and also gives aggregation based results.

	Elysium offers a set of correlation rules and behavioral analytics to alert on specific sequence of events or pattern using machine learning and statistical analysis. 
	The alerting feature notifies you when data from one or conditions are met. 
	For example, you might want to receive an email if your application logs more than five HTTP 503 errors in one hour, or you might want to page a developer if no new records have been processed in the past 20 minutes. 
	
	###3.	Endpoint <span id="endpoint"><span>
	Endpoint Dashboard analysis provides traffic and attacks in real-time by monitoring high velocity connections and port scans across devices within the corporate network.

	It has scoring:  0 to 60% normal, 60 to 90 as unsafe behavior, and 90% or higher as insider threat. 
	By using risk-based Scoring, which performs data sketches across time intervals on security metrics baselining the behaviors of all users and entities,
	we gain full visibility into any anomalous and suspicious behavior through risk-based scoring of the security data.
